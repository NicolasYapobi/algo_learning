# Maximum Subarray Sum

## Explanation

Given an array **arr[]**, the task is to find the subarray that has the **maximum sum** and return its **sum**

## Examples ##

    Input: arr[] = {2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3}
    Output: 11
    Explanation: The subarray {7, -1, 2, 3} has the largest sum 11.

    Input: arr[] = {-2, -4}
    Output: â€“2
    Explanation: The subarray {-2} has the largest sum -2.

    Input: arr[] = {5, 4, 1, 7, 8}
    Output: 25
    Explanation: The subarray {5, 4, 1, 7, 8} has the largest sum 25.

## My First approach ##

The first array and second arrary hint me with the maximum number of the list
    
    Input: arr[] = {2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3} ### 7 is the maximum

    Input: arr[] = {-2, -4} ### -2 is the maximum
